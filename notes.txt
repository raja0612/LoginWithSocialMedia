Oauth 2.0 is an industry standard protocal for authorization. This protocal provides
bunch of tools, patterns and best practices to integrate the authorization flows for 
web, desktop applications and mobile phones, and living room devices.

Mostly Oauth 2.0 follows below three steps.

1. Your application opens up window with third party login for authorization.
2. After successful authorization on the third party app, that app will redirectt with pre defined url.
3. Your application handles that redircet url and make another call to API to fetch acess token
   based on response code from above redircet call.
